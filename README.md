## Project Overview 

My group and I utilized sales data from 2019 - 2020 for a fictional winery called Mt Vernon. Group project 1 consisted of making a variety of data visualizations that showed a sales decrease in 2020. Through our visuals we highlighted potential marketing opportunities in order to increase sales. 

Group project 2 consisted of creating a story board of Mt Vernon's that would promote the company based on their success. We highlighted Florida and Ohio as strong areas in the company's business plan as well as increased sales in the spring and summer.
